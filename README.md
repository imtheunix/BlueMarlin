BlueMarlin is a browser extension made to block malicious websites, avoid phishing attack, malwares, harmful applications etc..

Google safe browsing API implemented to check redirections.

To be done:

Connect to more queries to search malicious websites lists;
SSL certificate validation;
Page content and script analysis;
Educational components;
UI and behavior improvement;
History URL's to regex if redirect URL is trying to simulate a real one (ex: Llnkedln)
User feedback form.

If you enjoyed the idea, you help paying one coffe so I can continue working on it:
